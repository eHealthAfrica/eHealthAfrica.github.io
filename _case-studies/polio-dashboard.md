> Nigeria has made remarkable progress against polio, but continued vigilance is needed to protect these gains and ensure that polio does not return. [...] Immunization and surveillance activities must continue to rapidly detect a potential re-introduction or re-emergence of the virus.

Polio is a virus that causes paralysis, usually in the legs. The first recognisable description of the polio virus is from 1789, but depictions of it can be seen in art as far back as ancient Egypt. 

In the late 19th century, outbreaks in Europe and the US became more and more common, reaching pandemic levels during the first half of the twentieth century. In the 1950s a vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk; the US was eventually declared polio-free in 1994, Europe in 2002. 

In 2013 the WHO announced its intention to eradicate the disease globally by 2018, but at that point Nigeria had suffered from a huge increase in cases, mainly due to a fatwa against the vaccine that was declared in 2003. In 2013, 9 health workers were killed by armed motorcyclists in Kano (where eHealth Africa has its headquarters).

Since then, there has been enormous progress: the last recorded case was in July 2014, and the WHO removed Nigeria from the endemic list in 2015. If there are no new cases reported, it will be declared polio-free in 2017. This will be a huge step along the way to global eradication.

## eHealth Africa's role in the fight against polio

In 2012, we received funds from The Gates Foundation to build and manage Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs) in the northern states with the highest infection rates, and a National Polio EOC in Abuja to coordinate activities between state governments and national agencies.  eHA provides effective management, a fully-equipped working space and fast internet speed in Nigeria for the EOC - a challenge for agencies working in insecure or remote regions.

Our Geographic Information Systems (GIS) team has already captured 10 TB of data for Nigeria, which has enabled data collectors to map previously missed settlements, often in insecure regions. The software is loaded onto GIS enabled tablets which the data collectors then use to gather crucial demographic information. This assists local governments and partners with  microplanning activities, ensuring that more children are reached in large scale immunization campaigns in Kano and Bauchi states.

The vaccinators in these campaigns carry GPS-enabled mobile phones which track their movements and promptly identify missed settlements. So far we have identified 782 previously undocumented hamlet settlements, thereby ensuring that ever more children receive polio vaccinations.
