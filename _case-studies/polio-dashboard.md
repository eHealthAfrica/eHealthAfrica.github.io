Working towards the global eradication of the polio virus
</section>

> Nigeria has made remarkable progress against polio, but continued vigilance is needed to protect these gains and ensure that polio does not return. Immunization and surveillance activities must continue to rapidly detect a potential re-introduction or re-emergence of the virus.

Polio is a virus that causes paralysis, usually in the legs. The first recognisable description of the polio virus is from 1789, but depictions of it can be seen in art as far back as ancient Egypt. 

Outbreaks began to occur in Europe and the US in the late 19th century. During the first half of the twentieth century, these outbreaks reached pandemic levels, until a vaccine was developed in the 1950s. The US was eventually declared polio-free in 1994, Europe in 2002. 

In 2013 the WHO announced that it intends to eradicate the disease globally by 2018, but at that point Nigeria had suffered from a huge increase in cases, mainly due to a fatwa against the vaccine that was declared in 2003. In 2013, 9 health workers were killed by armed motorcyclists in Kano (where eHealth Africa has its headquarters).

Since then, there has been enormous progress: the last recorded case was in July 2014, and the WHO removed Nigeria from the endemic list in 2015. If there are no new cases reported, it will be declared polio-free in 2017. This will be a huge step along the way to global eradication.
