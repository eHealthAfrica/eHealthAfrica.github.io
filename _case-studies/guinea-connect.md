Until early 2016 data collection, integration, analysis and visualization of health care data in Guinea were handled by the health care estructures (health posts, health centre, hospitals...) and by several different NGO is spreadsheets and text documents. These documents were produced using different tools, and stored independently by different reporting units (the Prefetoral and Regional Directions of Health, the Ministry of Health, the different NGOs...) 

The data collection, analysis and storage processes were largely manual, labor-intensive, time-consuming, and not standardized. Reports were not being analysed for quality nor compared with data from other periods or related data collected by other groups. In addition to this data took days in reach the decission makers, making it hard to take good fast decissions to respond to issues and improve health care quality and coverage.

Guinea Connect was born as an idea in August 2015 as the eHealth Africa team in Guinea was working in a proposal for an Integrated Community Health Post Project for the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. The main purpose of the proposal, for the Integrated Community Health Posts Pilot, was to refurbish and equip a set of health facilities, and to build capacity by evaluating health care workers, sending a qualified Doctor to train them, and making learning materials available in the long term.

What if we could use this opportunity of working very close to the lower levels of health care to use our experience with data? How could we improve reporting from the base, harmonise indicators and reduce the time data takes to reach the decission makers? What if this data could be made available to other partners to support them in their programs? What if we could, in exchange, use their open data too? These questions motivated us to start the Guinea Connect Program.

## The Central Management Dashboard

The Central Management Dashboard (CMD in the future) lists and maps health facilities and health care workers, as well as information for each of them: their monthly activity reports, details about the facility infrastructure and the personnel working on them, data analytics... This Central Management Dashboard, protected with a password that makes sure that each block of data is only available to the people with legitimate access rights to it, will be linked with other Public health decission making systems, like iHRIS and DHIS2. This symbiosis ensures data is synchronised among platforms and that efforts converge towards a common goal.

## The Closed User Group

To reinforce this mandate of convergence Guinea Connect also includes the management of a ministerial Closed User Group Management. We  handle the mobile phones and tablets used by health care workers and NGO workers under the umbrella of the Ministry of Health, making it possible to offer free calls among them and giving them free access to the Guinea Connect Dashboard and the forms they need to do data collection, so that their work is not affected by their phone credit. Te Closed User Group also lets us remotely install apllications, track lost devices and delete the data in them, so that information never falls in the wrong hands.

In January 2015, eHA launched Guinea Connect as part of the Integrated Community Health Post pilot in the prefecture of Pita, by helping health facilities produce their very first digital monthly reports.
