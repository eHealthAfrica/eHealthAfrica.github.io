As in most countries data integration, analysis and visualization in Guinea are handled by several different spreadsheets and text documents, using several different tools and formats. Data processes and workflows are still largely manual, labor-intensive, time-consuming, and not standardized. 

Guinea Connect is born as an idea in August 2015 with the mission of improving reporting, harmonisation and availability of healthcare data, activities and events, supporting decision making for the Ministry of Health and its partners to improve the quality and reach of care.

The Guinea Connect platform revolves around a central management dashboard that lists and maps health facilities and health care workers, as well as information for each of them: their monthly activity reports, details about the facility infrastructure and the personnel working on them... and is complemented by various modules including a Closed User Group Management to handle mobiles and tablets used by workers managed by the Ministry of Health, a Data Store to share and archive working documents, training modules or a Patient Records system. All of this information in one place, protected with password access and different access levels for different users and made available to other platforms like DHIS2 or iHRIS.

In January 2015, eHA launched Guinea Connect as part of the Integrated Community Health Post pilot in the prefecture of Pita, by helping health facilities produce their very first digital monthly reports.

The pilot programm sponsored by the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, also entails refurbishing six Health Posts, building one Health Post, transforming the former health center building into a residential facility for center workers, and building a new suitable Health Center. eHA will temporarily support operations in all facilities and gradually hand over to a newly created Community Association, which will ensure sustainability. The association will be composed of members from existing community groups and the diaspora.
