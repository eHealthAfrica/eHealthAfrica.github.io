As an organization, we benefit greatly from our FOSS nature of our tech stack, which is why we try to contribute back.

Nonetheless, every repository we start *is private by default*. This is because of the sensitive nature of the data our apps handle, the fact that a lot of internal discussions happen on GitHub issues and how easy it is to commit keys or similar to disastrous effect.

To open–source a repository:
1. Get a go–ahead from the responsible PO/PM or Justin
2. Squash your commits to simplify review
3. Open a GitHub issue about it
4. Get two +1 on the issue from other developers who are required to look through the codebase and commit history for sensitive information that might prevent open–sourcing the repository.

Regardless of the closed or open nature of a repository, we use the [Apache License Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) for our codebases.

All of our open–source contributions can be found in [our GitHub organization](https://github.com/ehealthafrica).
